1. Prior to starting work on a new lab
	- [Open an issue](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-well-architected-labs/issues/new) with your lab idea with a brief summary explaining how it fits into the Well-Architected labs, and an outline of your idea. Make sure to add a Label with the Well-Architected Pillar (i.e. COST)
	- A Well-Architected Lead will reach out to confirm or get additional context on your idea
2. For a description of how Hugo's directory structure works, [see this:](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/#directory-structure-explained)
3. Labs are built using Hugo and the Learn theme, which utilizes markdown. You can see the Markdown reference for Hugo [here](https://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown-quick-reference/https://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown-quick-reference/)
4. For a sample lab, look at the existing labs .md file
5. File structure (note case sensitivity:
	- All labs must belong to a pillar (if they can cross over, you may want to make them reusable via short codes).
	- The pillar directories are located in `/content/<Pillar Name>/<lab level>/<content folder for lab>`. For instance, you would put a 100 level performance lab in `/content/Performance Efficiency/100_Labs/100_my_new_lab`
	- No spaces in file names
	- `_index.md` is required in the root folder for your lab, itâ€™s the lab landing page (old README.md) and then each step is its own markdown file, prefaced with the order number. (For example: `1_starthere.md`, `2_do_a_thing.md`, `3_cleanup.md`).
		- You can also create a directory structure to hold additional markdown content as needed (MUST be markdown files, non-markdown files are in static)
	- All files must have front-matter at the top of the file.  See [this](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/) for more information.
		- For all front-matter, make sure you have a title defined and a weight. The weight is used to order the labs.
	- Non-markdown Code must be stored in `/static/(shortpillarname)/(content folder for lab)/code`
	- Images must be stored in `/static/(shortpillarname)/(content folder for lab)/Images`
		- Image size should be that of a laptop screen. Roughly `1000px x 700px` is good, if you use larger images they get scaled & are hard to read
		- Image width MUST always be `>800px`, which stops images from being placed next to text. Create the image border and then resize with whitespace
		- Ensure there is a black border around the images by formatting your images using the following structure `![Images/(your image.png)](/(shortpillarname)/(content folder for lab)/Images/(your image.png)?classes=lab_picture_small)`

### Picture Formatting
When you update a lab picture please ensure it had the following:
* Black boarder
* Orange box's to show the item the customer is looking for
* Role/AccountID hidden using the same colour as the section 
* Image width MUST always be `>800px`, which stops images from being placed next to text. Create the image border and then resize with whitespace
* The description above the image much match the image e.g. if you say use 2688Mb then the picture must have 2688Mb

An example can be seen below:

**Step example** :
1. Role name LambdaOrgRole, click Create role:
![Images/create_role.png](/Cost/300_Organization_Data_CUR_Connection/Images/create_role.png)


### Verify your edits and/or additions
After making the changes or additions test and verify locally
 - Navigate back to the aws-well-architected-labs parent folder
 - Serve the content locally:

        hugo serve -D

 - Open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313)
 - Verify the change you made was correct and no problems were introduced

### Push your changes to the remote repository:
Push your changes to GitHub, so that they are stored and backed up by GitHub. Use the following commands:

        git add -A
        git commit -m "your comment here"
        git push

{{% notice note %}}
Please write a descriptive commit message following [this](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project) guidance. Smaller meaningful commits are better than one large commit with lots of changes
{{% /notice %}}

  ![Images/gitcommit.png](/Contributing/Images/gitcommit.png?classes=lab_picture_small)

All your changes will be in the remote repository in GitHub, which can now be merged into the Well-Architected Labs repository.

### Review process

{{% notice note %}}
**New labs** require an additional validation step of two peer reviews. Please have **two peers review your lab** step by step to confirm it is working as expected prior to submitting a pull request.
