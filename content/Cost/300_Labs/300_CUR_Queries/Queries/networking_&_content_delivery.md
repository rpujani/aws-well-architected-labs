CUR Query Library uses placeholder variables, indicated by a dollar sign and curly braces (**${  }**). **${table_name}** and **${date_filter}** are common placeholder variables used throughout CUR Query Library, which must be replaced before a query will run. For example, if your CUR table is called **cur_table** and is in a database called **cur_db**, you would replace **${table_name}** with **cur_db.cur_table**. For **${date_filter}**, you have multiple options. See [Filtering by Date]({{< ref "/Cost/300_labs/300_CUR_Queries/Query_Help#filtering-by-date" >}}) in the CUR Query Library Help section for additional details.

### Imbalance Inter-Az Data Transfer

#### Query Description
This query shows cost and usage of inbalance inter-az data transfer last month.  These resources are commonly collectors or aggregators mostly receiving data from other resources in different Availability Zones.  Distributing the resource functionality to each of the Availability Zones and redirect the data transfer from sending sources to be within the same Availability Zone will eliminate the $0.01/GB data transfer charges between Availability Zones.

#### Pricing
The [Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/) is a useful tool for assisting with cost estimates for data transfer costs.  To aid in Cost Analysis we highly recommend implementing the [Data Transfer Cost Analysis Dashboard](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_enterprise_dashboards/3_create_data_transfer_cost_analysis/).
