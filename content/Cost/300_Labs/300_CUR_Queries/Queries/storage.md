CUR Query Library uses placeholder variables, indicated by a dollar sign and curly braces (**${  }**). **${table_name}** and **${date_filter}** are common placeholder variables used throughout CUR Query Library, which must be replaced before a query will run. For example, if your CUR table is called **cur_table** and is in a database called **cur_db**, you would replace **${table_name}** with **cur_db.cur_table**. For **${date_filter}**, you have multiple options. See [Filtering by Date]({{< ref "/Cost/300_labs/300_CUR_Queries/Query_Help#filtering-by-date" >}}) in the CUR Query Library Help section for additional details.

### Amazon EBS Snapshots Copy

#### Query Description
This query helps correlate cross-region data transfer cost and usage with EBS Snapshot Copy operations for specific EBS snapshots. Understanding the amount of data transfer associated with specific snapshots, and tangentially how much data change is happening on the associated volume, can be used to inform changes to snapshotting strategy. The query provides total unblended cost and usage information grouped by snapshot, usage type, and line item description. Output is sorted by cost in descending order. 

#### Pricing
EBS Snapshot Copy is charged according to data transferred across regions. Please refer to the [data transfer section of the Amazon EC2 pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/#Data_Transfer).
