CUR Query Library uses placeholder variables, indicated by a dollar sign and curly braces (**${  }**). **${table_name}** and **${date_filter}** are common placeholder variables used throughout CUR Query Library, which must be replaced before a query will run. For example, if your CUR table is called **cur_table** and is in a database called **cur_db**, you would replace **${table_name}** with **cur_db.cur_table**. For **${date_filter}**, you have multiple options. See [Filtering by Date]({{< ref "/Cost/300_labs/300_CUR_Queries/Query_Help#filtering-by-date" >}}) in the CUR Query Library Help section for additional details.
