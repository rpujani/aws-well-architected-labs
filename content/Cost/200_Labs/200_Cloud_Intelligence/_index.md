## Introduction
Do you know how much you’re spending per hour on AWS Lambda? How about per S3 bucket? How do you know buying Savings Plan or using Spot Instances is saving you money? Does your team know how much their application costs to run on AWS? Visualizing and understanding your cost and usage data is critical to good cloud financial management and accountability.

Cloud Financial Management (CFM) is the practice of bringing financial accountability to the variable spend model of cloud. CFM practitioners are pursuing business efficiency across all of their accounts by first visualizing their cost and usage, then setting goals, and finally driving accountability from their IT teams to meet or exceed these goals. 

Cloud infrastructure provides more agility and responsiveness than traditional IT environments. This requires organizations to think differently about how they design, build, and manage applications.

Cloud resources are disposable, and with a pay-per-use model it requires a strong integration between IT governance and organizational governance. Builders need to be able to operate in a cloud environment that’s agile and safe at the same time.

This Well Architected lab will walk you through implementing a series of dashboards for all of your AWS accounts that will help you drive financial accountability, optimize cost, track usage goals, implement best-practices for governance, and achieve operational excellence.

The Cost Intelligence Dashboard is a customizable and accessible dashboard to help create the foundation of your own cost management and optimization (FinOps) tool. Executives, directors, and other individuals within the CFO's line of business or who manage cloud financials for an organization will find the Cloud Intelligence Dashboard easy to use and relevant to their use cases. Little to no technical knowledge or understanding of AWS Services is required. Out-of-the-box benefits of the CID include (but are not limited to):

* Create chargeback or showback reports for internal business units, accounts, or cost centers.
* Track how Savings Plans (SP), Reserved Instances (RI), and Spot Instance usage has impacted your unit metrics such as your average hourly cost of Amazon EC2.
* Keep track of which accounts or internal business units receive savings and when RIs and SPs expire.  

**Services used:** AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR), Amazon Athena, AWS Glue, Amazon S3, and Amazon QuickSight.

### CUDOS Dashboard

## Authors

The CUDOS Dashboard is an in-depth, granular, and recommendation-driven dashboard to help customers dive deep into cost and usage and to fine-tune efficiency. Executives, directors, and other individuals within the CIO or CTO line of business or who manage DevOps and IT organizations will find the CUDOS Dashboard highly detailed and tailored to solve their use cases. Out-of-the-box benefits of the CUDOS dashboard include (but are not limited to):

* Use the built-in tag explorer to group and filter cost and usage by your tags.
* View resource-level detail such as your hourly AWS Lambda or individual Amazon S3 bucket costs.
* Get alerted to service-level areas of focus such as top 3 On-Demand database instances by cost.

**Services used:** AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR), Amazon Athena, AWS Glue, Amazon S3, and Amazon QuickSight.

### Trusted Advisor Organizational (TAO) Dashboard

Amazon Trusted Advisor helps you optimize your AWS infrastructure, improve security and performance, reduce overall costs, and monitors service limits. Organizational view lets you view Trusted Advisor checks for all accounts in your AWS Organizations. The only way to visualize the organizational view is to use the TAO dashboard. The TAO dashboard is a set of visualizations that provide comprehensive details and trends across your entire AWS Organization. Out-of-the-box benefits of the TAO dashboard include (but are not limited to):


* Quickly locate accounts that haven't rotated their AWS IAM keys.
* Find then sort unutilized and underutilized resources by cost or account.
* See a list of accounts that have reached 80% of individual service limits.

**Services used:** AWS Trusted Advisor, AWS Trusted Advisor Organizational report, Amazon Athena, AWS Glue, Amazon S3, and Amazon QuickSight.
